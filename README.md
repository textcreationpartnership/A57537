priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ.

      * Verse 6.Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in
Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on
him shall not be confounded.

      * Verse 7.Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them
which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner,Verse 8.And a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence, even to them
which stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they
were appointed.

a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath

of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained

abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.

      * Verse 12.Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that

works which they shall behold, glorifie God in the day of visitation.

      * Verse 13.Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords

    _ CHAP. III.

if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by
the conversation of the wives.

      * Verse 2.While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with
fear.

      * Verse 3.Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
the hair, and of wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel.Verse 4.But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible,
even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price.

      * Verse 5.For after this maner in the old time, the holy women also who
trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their
own husbands.Verse 6.Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose
daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
amazement.

      * Verse 7.Likewise ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowlege,
giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not
hindred.

      * Verse 8.Finally, be ye all of one minde, having compassion one of another,
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous,Verse 9.Not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise
blessing, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should
inherit a blessing.

      * Verse 10.For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.Verse 11.Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace and
ensue it.

      * Verse 12.For the eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his
ears are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against
them that do evil.

      * Verse 13.And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
which is good?

      * Verse 14.But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye, and be
not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.

      * Verse 15.But sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always
to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope
that is in you, with meekness and fear.

      * Verse 16.Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of
you, as of evil doers, they may be ashamed that falsly accuse your good
conversation in Christ.

      * Verse 17.For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well-doing, then for evil doing.

      * Vers. 18.For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit.

      * Verse 19.By which also he went and preached to the Spirits in Prison:Verse 20.Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long suffering
of God waited in the days of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

      * Verse 21.The like figure whereunto, even Baptism, doth also now
save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
of a good conscience towards God) by the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ.

      * Verse 22.Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
angels, and authorities, and powers, being made subject unto him.

    _ CHAP. IV.

      * Verse 1.Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
arm your selves likewise with the same minde; for he that hath
suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sin:Verse 2.That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh
to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

      * Verse 3.For the time past of our life may suffice us, to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess
of wine, revellings, banquettings, and abominable idolatries.

      * Verse 4.Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to
the same excess of ryot, speaking evil of you.

      * Verse 5.Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the
quick and the dead.

      * Ver. 6.For for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they
might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.

      * Vers. 7.But the end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober, and
watch unto prayer.

      * Vers. 8.And above all things, have fervent charity among your selves:
for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

      * Verse 9.Use hospitallity one to another without grudging.

      * Verse 10.As every man hath received the gift, even so minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace
of God.

      * Verse 11.If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God: If
any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth,
that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to
whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.

      * Verse 12.Beloved, think it not strange, concerning the fiery tryal,
which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.Verse 13.But rejoyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings,
that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
exceeding joy.

      * Verse 14.And if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are
ye, for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you; on their
part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

      * Verse 15.But let none of you suffer as a murtherer, or as a thief, or as
an evil doer, or as a busie body in other mens matters.Verse 16.Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed,
but let him glorifie God on this behalf.

      * Verse 17.For the time is come, that judgement must begin at the house
of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that
obey not the Gospel of God?

      * Verse 18.And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly
and the sinner appear?

      * Verse 19.Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God,
commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a
faithful Creator.

    _ CHAP. V.

Elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker

thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
but of a ready minde.

to the flock.

      * Verse 4.And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
crown of glory that fadeth not away.

      * Verse 5.Likewise ye yonger, submit your selves unto the elder; yea,
all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility,
for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

      * Verse 6.Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
that he may exalt you in due time.

      * Verse 7.Casting all your care on him, for he careth for you.

      * Verse 8.Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as
